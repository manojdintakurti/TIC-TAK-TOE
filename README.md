🕹️ React Tic Tac Toe Game
A fun and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with React to showcase my frontend skills. It features a clean UI, responsive layout, and dynamic game logic using React hooks.

🚀 How to Play
Two players take turns marking X and O on the grid.

The first to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

If all cells are filled with no winner, it's a draw.

Once you understand the rules, go ahead and play! 🎮
This game is perfect for testing your strategy or just having a bit of fun while exploring a React-based project.
